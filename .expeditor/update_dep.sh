# What is this script?
#
# Chef Aply uses a workflow tool called Expeditor to manage version bumps,
# changelogs, and releases. When a dependency is released expeditor is triggered
# against this repository to run this script. It bumps our gem lock files and opens
# a PR. That way humans can do hard work and bots can open gem bump PRs.
